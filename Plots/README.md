The files in this directory are organized as follows:

- `analysis` contains the MATLAB scripts that were used to generate plots used in analysis of results. They were originally in this directory and the paths may not be correct.
- `include` contains MATLAB functions used by the various plots. 

This root directory (i.e., `Plots`) contains the scripts, both MATLAB and Python, that were used to generate the final figures and data points for the manuscript and supplemental materials. The scripts used for supplemental materials contains the code `esm` as part of the filename (e.g., `bfa_esm_clinical_probability.m`). If the scripts are likely to be specific to Burkina Faso they are also prefixed with the ISO Alpha-3 country code (BFA).
