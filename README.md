## PSU-CIDD-Burkina-Faso
---
This repository contains configuration, GIS, analysis files used for modeling the prevalence of malaira (*P. falciparum*) in Burkina Faso. These configuratoins are primarly intended to study 1) the development of antimalaria resistnace in the parasite, and 2) possible interventions that the National Malaria Control Programme can impliment.

The main repository for the simuation can be found at [maciekboni/PSU-CIDD-Malaria-Simulation](https://github.com/maciekboni/PSU-CIDD-Malaria-Simulation)

### Organziation
Analysis/         - Scripts and data related to analysis subtasks (ex., movement calibration).

Analysis/Common   - Common MATLAB functions.

Analysis/Movement - MATLAB scripts used for movement analysis and
